# CompleteTypesTopology

Formalization of the usual topology of complete n-types over a first-order theory.

We show that this topology is a polish space by proving that it is
second-countable, hausdorff and compact.

Using results on polish spaces in mathlib we get that
for a countable language L there are either countably many or continuum many complete n-types over an L-Theory T.
